Hi, I'm Izzy Chavira!
I am 23 years old and recently graduated from UC Berkeley with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. 
Iâ€™m looking for work in game development, more specifically gameplay programming. 
I have experience using Unity and Visual Studio and am confident programming in C#, Python, C++, Java, and SQL.
